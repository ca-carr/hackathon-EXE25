## Schedule

### Tuesday 27th May
- **09:45am** Introduction
- **10:00am** The Offline Blockchain
- **11:00am** Building a Blockchain, from Design to Implementation
- **12:30pm** Lunch break until 01:30pm

- **02:30pm** Break until 3.30pm

## Plan

First we will look at the very basic ideas of coming to a form of decentralised consensus in a simple offline setting. We will work in groups, and take part as senders, attackers and verifiers. 

We will then explore the practicalities of building actual blockchains and what we must consider. We will use Github Codespaces, Python and Docker to send and receive information/transactions in our network. 

After lunch we will visit the idea of post-quantum cryptography in the blockchain landscape and consider how it works, what it looks like in practice, and the implications to fintech in general.
