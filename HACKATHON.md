## Title: Building Blockchains; from the conceptual to the practical and beyond.

- Lead: Christopher Carr

## Schedule

### Tuesday 27th May

Below is a _rough_ schedule for the day.
- **09:45am** Introduction
- **10:00am** The Offline Blockchain (GAME-1)
- **11:00am** Building a Blockchain Network, from Design to Implementation
- **12:00pm** Quantum and Post Quantum, Ideas and Applications
- **01:00pm** Lunch until 2:00pm

## Plan

First we will play a game, and look at the very basic ideas of coming to a form of decentralised consensus in an offline setting. We will work in groups, and take part as senders, attackers and verifiers. 

We will then explore the practicalities of building actual blockchains and what we must consider. We will use tools like Github Codespaces, AWS, Python and Docker to create our own p2p network, and send and receive information/transactions.

Finally, we will visit the idea of post-quantum cryptography in the blockchain landscape and consider how it works, what it looks like in practice, and the implications to fintech in general.
